    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. 
        Understanding <strong>time complexity</strong> helps in writing more efficient code and selecting algorithms that run efficiently for large datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
        Optimizing <b>Space Complexity</b> is important in scenarios where memory usage is critical, and it is often expressed in terms of O(n) notation.
