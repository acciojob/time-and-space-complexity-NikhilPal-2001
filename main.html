    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. 
        Understanding time complexity helps in writing efficient code and selecting algorithms that perform well for large datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. 
        It is often expressed in terms of O(n) notation.
